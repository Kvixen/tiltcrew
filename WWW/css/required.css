ATTENTION:
This is a css that is imported into ALL pages. So don't change specific details inside of here.
This is supposed to work for every page.
If you make a change inside of this, it should be a required change for all pages.
If you're unsure wether to add css or remove in here, think about if you only want that change on the page you're currently working on or all pages.
If the answer is the current one you're working on then you're on the wrong css page. Please make a new one.
